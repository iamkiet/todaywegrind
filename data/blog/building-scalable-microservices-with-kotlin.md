# Introduction

Microservices architecture has become increasingly popular for building scalable, maintainable applications. In this post, I'll share my experience building microservices using **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot**.

## Why Kotlin for Microservices?

Kotlin offers several advantages for microservices development:

- **Concise syntax** - Less boilerplate code compared to Java
- **Null safety** - Prevents null pointer exceptions at compile time
- **Coroutines** - Excellent support for asynchronous programming
- **Java interoperability** - Can leverage existing Java libraries

## Setting up the Project

First, let's create a new Spring Boot project with Kotlin:

```kotlin
@SpringBootApplication
class MicroserviceApplication

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    runApplication<MicroserviceApplication>(*args)
}
```

## Configuration

Here's a sample application configuration:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
spring:
  application:
    name: user-service
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/userdb
    username: ${DB_USER:user}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD:password}
```

## Best Practices

Here are some key practices I've learned:

1. **Keep services small and focused** - Each service should have a single responsibility
2. **Use event-driven communication** - Implement async messaging with Kafka
3. **Implement proper monitoring** - Use tools like Micrometer and Prometheus
4. **Design for failure** - Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms

> **Pro tip**: Always design your microservices with failure in mind. Network calls will fail, services will go down, and databases will become unavailable.

## Performance Considerations

When building microservices, consider:

| Aspect        | Recommendation                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Response Time | < 200ms for critical APIs      |
| Throughput    | Design for 10x current load    |
| Memory        | Keep heap usage under 80%      |
| CPU           | Monitor and alert at 70% usage |

## Conclusion

Kotlin provides an excellent foundation for building microservices. The language's features align well with modern distributed system requirements.
